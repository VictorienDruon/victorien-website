Discover new movies and shows, share your favorites with friends, and save them to your watchlist! Movie Network is a dynamic application that empowers users to explore, share, and save their favorite films and TV shows. In addition to discovering new content, users can connect with like-minded movie enthusiasts and friends.

## **Context**

I was tired of always having a lot of movies I wanted to see but never remembering them when I was looking for something to watch. I had already tried a few apps, but I always found them too complicated and not user-friendly. I wanted to create a simple and intuitive app that would allow me to save movies and shows to my watchlist and share them with my friends.\
I've developed this app on my own during my free time, and it was the opportunity for me to learn mobile development.

## **Features**

**Discover Movies and TV Shows:** Users can search and browse a comprehensive database of movies and TV shows.

**Social Features:** Share your favorite movies and TV shows with friends and fellow movie enthusiasts in a Twitter-like space.

**Save for Later:** Save movies and TV shows to your personal collection for easy access later.

**Gather Every Information You Need:** Get all the information you need about a movie or a TV show, including the cast, the crew, the plot, the trailers, the reviews, and where to watch it.

## **New version**

After completing the app's development, I got in touch with a highly talented designer to improve the UI and UX of the app. We are currently in the process of creating a new version of the app, and I am rewriting it from scratch using SwiftUI.
