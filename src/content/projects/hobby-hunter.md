Share your tastes with the world! Hobby Hunter is a web app that allows you to showcase your Spotify library in a nostalgic coverflow-like design, reminiscent of the classic iPod interface. With Hobby Hunter, you can present your music collection in a fun and engaging way.

## **Context**

Seeing the success of [Dockhunt](https://www.dockhunt.com/) at the time, I wanted to create a similar app but for musics. I loved the coverflow design of the iPod, and I wanted to recreate it in a web app.\
Having just finished learning JavaScript and React, it was the perfect opportunity for me to practice my skills and learn new technologies. Being my first real world project, I struggled a lot for getting started, but I've never learned so much in such a short time and I'm very proud of the result.

## **Features**

- **Coverflow Design:** Enjoy a visually pleasing and nostalgic coverflow interface to browse your Spotify library.

- **Spotify Integration:** Connect your Spotify account to Hobby Hunter and import your music collection effortlessly with Spotify OAuth 2.0

- **User Profiles**: Create and personalize your profile to share your music tastes with the world.

## **Ideas**

- **Support for other music streaming services:** Support for Apple Music, Deezer, Tidal, etc.
- **Create playlists:** Create playlists directly from your Hobby Hunter library.
- **Books integration**: Import your books from Goodreads and share your reading list in a iOS 6 iBooks-like design (skeuomorphic bookshelf).
- **Movie Network integration:** Import your movies and TV shows from Movie Network and share your watchlist.
