Welcome to the Star Wars Timeline project! Star Wars Timeline offers a straightforward guide on how to watch the iconic Star Wars saga using different viewing orders. Whether you're new to the franchise or a seasoned Jedi, this website will help you choose the viewing order that suits you best.

## **Context**

Already familiar with web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as Python frameworks (Django and Flask), my brother motivated me to test out React development with Next.js. This project was an opportunity for me to discover the React ecosystem and its concepts while working on a fun project. It motivated me to learn React in-depth a few months later.

## **Features**

- **Multiple viewing orders:** Choose between the different viewing orders available to watch the Star Wars saga.
- **Every piece of information you need:** Get all the information you need about the movies and TV shows of the Star Wars franchise.
- **Jump straight to Disney+:** Watch the Star Wars saga directly on Disney+ with the provided links.
