The official website for the 2024 Gala organized by Etuville serves as the primary platform for over 1500 attendees to access all necessary information about the event and reserve their shuttles for transportation.

## **Context**

As the Tech Manager of Etuville, a student association, I was responsible for the development of the website for the 2024 Gala. I lead a team of 2 developers in creating the web app from scratch.
