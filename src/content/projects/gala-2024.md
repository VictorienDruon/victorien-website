Learn about this year's Gala, buy your tickets, schedule your shuttle, and reserve your food and drinks for the night. This web app is the one and only place to get all the information you need about the Gala.

## **Context**

As the Tech Manager of Etuville, a student association of the Université de Technologie de Compiègne that organizes a Gala every year, I'm in charge of developing the web app for this year's Gala. The Gala is a big event that gathers more than 4000 people in a prestigious place. It's a night of celebration for the students of the university.\
I lead a small team of developers to build the web app. The Gala takes place in May 2024, and many features are still to be rolled out in the coming months.

## **Features**

- **Everything you need to know about the Gala:** Learn about the theme, the place, the date, the price, the dress code, etc.
- **Shuttle:** Schedule your shuttle to the Gala during a planned shotgun, first arrived, first served.
- **Food & Drinks:** Reserve your food and drinks in advance for the night.
