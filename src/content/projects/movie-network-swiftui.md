Discover new movies and shows, share your favorites with friends, and save them to your watchlist! Movie Network is a dynamic application that empowers users to explore, share, and save their favorite films and TV shows. In addition to discovering new content, users can connect with like-minded movie enthusiasts and friends.

## **Context**

To know more about the initial idea behind the app, check out the **[Movie Network React Native page](/projects/movie-network-react-native)**.\
This rethinking of the app is part of a collaboration with a highly talented designer who liked the app's concept and expressed interest in joining the project. I have chosen to rewrite the app from scratch using SwiftUI, both to delve into native iOS development and to align seamlessly with the new designs without compromise.

## **Work in progress**

This project is still in early stages of development.
